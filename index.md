## Welcome to my NYC Open Data Learning Page!

In order to learn GitHub, I wanted to first experiment with some of the tools available via **NYC Open Data**, using datasets that are made publicly available on their website. (Anyone can set up a Socrata account and try these out at [data.cityofnewyork.us](https://data.cityofnewyork.us)
Let's see how this works...

First, a visualization I created using their built-in web interface...it pulls emergency room visit data from the past two years...unfortunately, I cannot share the dynamic visualization format, so just had to post a screenshot...not great resolution but it's something...

The red line plotted on the graph is the total number of admissions for "influenza-like illness and/or Pneumonia".  It is interesting to see the rapid differentiation that was made early into the pandemic as doctors learned to identify COViD-19 symptoms as distinct from flu or pneumonia.  The influenza line increases at the approximate point of each new COViD variation.  You can find the dataset here:  [NY Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Emergency-Department-Visits-and-Admissions-for-Inf/2nwg-uqyg). (Visualized 1-26-22)

Of course, this was just a beginning...my next project:

[A project in heatmapping NYC arrest data using Python](https://github.com/amelia-ingram/hello-world/blob/gh-pages/Leaflet_map-NYC-web.ipynb)

And the output heatmap is produced here:
[Heatmap of NYC arrest data](https://github.com/amelia-ingram/hello-world/blob/gh-pages/heatmap.html)

Since it doesn't want to work right now, I'm posting another version here, based on the NYC Open Data visualization maker...it is definitely not as good as the one I produced in this project...

I'm going to continue working on this and some more interesting data visuals soon while I'm learning how to use GitHub...more to come...
